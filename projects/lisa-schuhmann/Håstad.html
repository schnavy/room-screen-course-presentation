            Whether it's warm and dubby deep house, driving sci-fi techno or polyrhythmic left-field breaks, Håstad's music collection knows no genre boundaries, only the appropriate setting.</br>
            The Leipzig-based DJ and producer has been marking his musical footprint on the local scene for about two years now. </br>
            As co-founder of the collective and party series MANIAC, as well as a member of the Electric Island crew, </br>
            he tries to transport his vision of contemporary yet timeless electronic sounds to the dance floors of the city and beyond, no matter what the occasion is.
